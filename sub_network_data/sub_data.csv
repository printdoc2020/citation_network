In addition to the bare details of the fact — a particular person, for example — each fact may have provenance, reliability, weight, and other attributes. Each fact may also be associated with other facts, e.g. that one person met another at a particular location. The analyst’s task is to examine a huge collection of such loosely-structured facts, and try to ""connect the dots"" to perceive the underlying and unknown causes — and their possible future courses. We have designed and implemented a Java platform called VIM to support intelligence analysts in their work.",Alan Keahey;Kenneth C. Cox,T.A. Keahey;K.C. Cox,Visintuit LLC,,,,0.0,5.0,

This framework aims to support human collaboration by making it easier to share representations, to translate from one point of view to another, to explain arguments, to update conclusions when underlying assumptions change, and to justify or account for decisions or actions. Multidimensional visualization techniques are used with interactive, context-sensitive, and tunable graphs. Visual representations are flexibly generated using a knowledge representation scheme based on annotated logic; this enables not only tracking and fusing different viewpoints, but also unpacking them. Fusing representations supports the creation of multidimensional meta-displays as well as the translation or mapping from one point of view to another. At the same time, analysts also need to be able to unpack one another's complex chains of reasoning, especially if they have reached different conclusions, and to determine the implications, if any, when underlying assumptions or evidence turn out to be false. The framework enables us to support a variety of scenarios as well as to systematically generate and test experimental hypotheses about the impact of different kinds of visual representations upon interactive collaboration by teams of distributed analysts",Susan Brennan;Klaus Mueller;Gregory J.

As the number of documents and the corresponding number of concepts and entities within the documents grow larger, sense-making processes become more and more difficult for the analysts. We have developed a visual analytic system called Jigsaw that represents documents and their entities visually in order to help analysts examine reports more efficiently and develop theories about potential actions more quickly. Jigsaw provides multiple coordinated views of document entities with a special emphasis on visually illustrating connections between entities across the different documents.",John T.

This process is often called ldquoconnecting the dots.rdquo When analysts interactively explore complex datasets over multiple sessions, they may uncover a large number of findings. As a result, it is often difficult for them to recall the past insights, views and concepts that are most relevant to their current line of inquiry. This challenge is even more difficult during collaborative analysis tasks where they need to find connections between their own discoveries and insights found by others. In this paper, we describe a context-based retrieval algorithm to identify notes, views and concepts from users' past analyses that are most relevant to a view or a note based on their line of inquiry. We then describe a related notes recommendation feature that surfaces the most relevant items to the user as they work based on this algorithm. We have implemented this recommendation feature in HARVEST, a Web based visual analytic system. We evaluate the related notes recommendation feature of HARVEST through a case study and discuss the implications of our approach.",Yedendra Babu Shrinivasan;David Gotz;Jie Lu,Yedendra B.

However, the high dropout rate of learners is considered to be one of the most crucial factors that may hinder the development of MOOCs. To tackle this problem, statistical models have been developed to predict dropout behavior based on learner activity logs. Although predictive models can foresee the dropout behavior, it is still difficult for users to understand the reasons behind the predicted results and further design interventions to prevent dropout. In addition, with a better understanding of dropout, researchers in the area of predictive modeling in turn can improve the models. In this paper, we introduce DropoutSeer, a visual analytics system which not only helps instructors and education experts understand the reasons for dropout, but also allows researchers to identify crucial features which can further improve the performance of the models. Both the heterogeneous data extracted from three different kinds of learner activity logs (i.e., clickstream, forum posts and assignment records) and the predicted results are visualized in the proposed system. Case studies and expert interviews have been conducted to demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of DropoutSeer.",Yuanzhe Chen;Qing Chen;Mingqian Zhao;Sebastien Boyer;Kalyan Veeramachaneni;Huamin Qu,Yuanzhe Chen;Qing Chen;Mingqian Zhao;Sebastien Boyer;Kalyan Veeramachaneni;Huamin Qu,"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China;Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China;Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China;Massachusetts Institute of Technology, United States of America;Massachusetts Institute of Technology, United States of America;Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China",10.1109/INFVIS.1999.801851;10.1109/TVCG.2015.2468151;10.1109/INFVIS.2000.885098;10.1109/VAST.2010.5652931;10.1109/TVCG.2010.129;10.1109/VAST.2012.6400557;10.1109/INFVIS.2001.963273;10.1109/TVCG.2013.221;10.1109/TVCG.2007.70515;10.1109/TVCG.2011.239,,4.0,8.0,41.0,
