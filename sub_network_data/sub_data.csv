Currently, these professional analysts use R, Stata, SAS, and other statistical software packages for uncovering insights from game data. Quantitative sports consultants seek a competitive advantage both for their clients and for themselves as analytics becomes increasingly valued by teams, clubs, and squads. In order for the information visualization community to support the members of this blossoming industry, it must recognize where and how visualization can enhance the existing analytical workflow. In this paper, we identify three primary stages of today's sports analyst's routine where visualization can be beneficially integrated: 1) exploring a dataspace; 2) sharing hypotheses with internal colleagues; and 3) communicating findings to stakeholders.Working closely with professional ice hockey analysts, we designed and built SnapShot, a system to integrate visualization into the hockey intelligence gathering process. SnapShot employs a variety of information visualization techniques to display shot data, yet given the importance of a specific hockey statistic, shot length, we introduce a technique, the radial heat map. Through a user study, we received encouraging feedback from several professional analysts, both independent consultants and professional team personnel.",Hannah Pileggi;Charles D. Stolper;J.

Currently, most analyses on such data relate to statistics on individual players or teams. However, soccer analysts we collaborated with consider that quantitative analysis alone does not convey the right picture of the game, as context, player positions and phases of player actions are the most relevant aspects. We designed SoccerStories to support the current practice of soccer analysts and to enrich it, both in the analysis and communication stages. Our system provides an overview+detail interface of game phases, and their aggregation into a series of connected visualizations, each visualization being tailored for actions such as a series of passes or a goal attempt. To evaluate our tool, we ran two qualitative user studies on recent games using SoccerStories with data from one of the world's leading live sports data providers. The first study resulted in a series of four articles on soccer tactics, by a tactics analyst, who said he would not have been able to write these otherwise. The second study consisted in an exploratory follow-up to investigate design alternatives for embedding soccer phases into word-sized graphics. For both experiments, we received a very enthusiastic feedback and participants consider further use of SoccerStories to enhance their current workflow.",Charles Perin;Romain Vuillemot;Jean-Daniel Fekete,Charles Perin;Romain Vuillemot;Jean-Daniel Fekete,INRIA and Universite Paris-Sud;INRIA;INRIA,10.1109/TVCG.2007.70582;10.1109/TVCG.2011.169;10.1109/TVCG.2011.185;10.1109/TVCG.2012.263,"Visual knowledge discovery, visual knowledge representation, sport analytics, visual aggregation",50.0,64.0,26.0,HM

Gathering and analyzing this data typically requires the use of an array of synchronized cameras, which are expensive for non-professional tennis matches. In this paper, we propose TenniVis, a novel tennis match visualization system that relies entirely on data that can be easily collected, such as score, point outcomes, point lengths, service information, and match videos that can be captured by one consumer-level camera. It provides two new visualizations to allow tennis coaches and players to quickly gain insights into match performance. It also provides rich interactions to support ad hoc hypothesis development and testing. We first demonstrate the usefulness of the system by analyzing the 2007 Australian Open men's singles final. We then validate its usability by two pilot user studies where two college tennis coaches analyzed the matches of their own players. The results indicate that useful insights can quickly be discovered and ad hoc hypotheses based on these insights can conveniently be tested through linked match videos.",Tom Polk;Jing Yang;Yueqi Hu;Ye Zhao,Tom Polk;Jing Yang;Yueqi Hu;Ye Zhao,University of North Carolina at Charlotte;University of North Carolina at Charlotte;University of North Carolina at Charlotte;Kent State University,10.1109/TVCG.2012.263;10.1109/TVCG.2013.192;10.1109/VISUAL.2001.964496;10.1109/INFVIS.1996.559229;10.1109/INFVIS.2002.1173148,"Visual knowledge discovery, sports analytics, tennis visualization",19.0,26.0,28.0,

We present a system for analyzing high-frequency position-based soccer data at various levels of detail, allowing to interactively explore and analyze for movement features and game events. Our Visual Analytics method covers single-player, multi-player and event-based analytical views. Depending on the task the most promising features are semi-automatically selected, processed, and visualized. Our aim is to help soccer analysts in finding the most important and interesting events in a match. We present a flexible, modular, and expandable layer-based system allowing in-depth analysis. The integration of Visual Analytics techniques into the analysis process enables the analyst to find interesting events based on classification and allows, by a set of custom views, to communicate the found results. The feedback loop in the Visual Analytics pipeline helps to further improve the classification results. We evaluate our approach by investigating real-world soccer matches and collecting additional expert feedback. Several use cases and findings illustrate the capabilities of our approach.",Halldór Janetzko;Dominik Sacha;Manuel Stein;Tobias Schreck;Daniel A.

With the advent of new technologies that allow all players and the ball to be tracked across the entire field, it is now possible to bring this understanding to another level. From discrete positions across time, we present techniques to reconstruct entire baseball games and visually explore each play. This provides opportunities to not only derive new metrics for the game, but also allow us to investigate existing measures with targeted visualizations. In addition, our techniques allow users to filter on demand so specific situations can be analyzed both in general and according to those situations. We show that gameplay can be accurately reconstructed from the raw position data and discuss how visualization and statistical methods can combine to better inform baseball analyses.",Carlos A.

This data recording creates opportunities to analyze and evaluate matches from new perspectives. Nevertheless, the increasingly complex data poses a significant challenge to make sense of and gain insights into. Analysts usually employ tedious and cumbersome methods which are limited to watching videos and reading statistical tables. However, existing sports visualization methods cannot be applied to visualizing table tennis competitions due to different competition rules and particular data attributes. In this work, we collaborate with data analysts to understand and characterize the sophisticated domain problem of analysis of table tennis data. We propose iTTVis, a novel interactive table tennis visualization system, which to our knowledge, is the first visual analysis system for analyzing and exploring table tennis data. iTTVis provides a holistic visualization of an entire match from three main perspectives, namely, time-oriented, statistical, and tactical analyses. The proposed system with several well-coordinated views not only supports correlation identification through statistics and pattern detection of tactics with a score timeline but also allows cross analysis to gain insights. Data analysts have obtained several new insights by using iTTVis. The effectiveness and usability of the proposed system are demonstrated with four case studies.",Yingcai Wu;Ji Lan;Xinhuan Shu;Chenyang Ji;Kejian Zhao;Jiachen Wang;Hui Zhang,Yingcai Wu;Ji Lan;Xinhuan Shu;Chenyang Ji;Kejian Zhao;Jiachen Wang;Hui Zhang,State Key Lab of CAD &#x0026; CGZhejiang University;State Key Lab of CAD &#x0026; CGZhejiang University;State Key Lab of CAD &#x0026; CGZhejiang University;State Key Lab of CAD &#x0026; CGZhejiang University;State Key Lab of CAD &#x0026; CGZhejiang University;State Key Lab of CAD &#x0026; CGZhejiang University;Department of Physical EducationCollege of EducationZhejiang University,10.1109/VAST.2014.7042478;10.1109/VAST.2014.7042477;10.1109/INFVIS.1996.559229;10.1109/TVCG.2011.208;10.1109/TVCG.2013.192;10.1109/TVCG.2012.263;10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346445;10.1109/TVCG.2012.213,"Sports visualization,visual knowledge discovery,sports analytics,visual knowledge representation",6.0,6.0,35.0,
