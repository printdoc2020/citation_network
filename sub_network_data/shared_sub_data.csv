We present a set of ten low level analysis tasks that largely capture people's activities while employing information visualization tools for understanding data. To help develop these tasks, we collected nearly 200 sample questions from students about how they would analyze five particular data sets from different domains. The questions, while not being totally comprehensive, illustrated the sheer variety of analytic questions typically posed by users when employing information visualization systems. We hope that the presented set of tasks is useful for information visualization system designers as a kind of common substrate to discuss the relative analytic capabilities of the systems.

After conducting an extensive review of Infovis systems and their interactive capabilities, we propose seven general categories of interaction techniques widely used in Infovis: 1) Select, 2) Explore, 3) Reconfigure, 4) Encode, 5) Abstract/Elaborate, 6) Filter, and 7) Connect. These categories are organized around a user's intent while interacting with a system rather than the low-level interaction techniques provided by a system.

We found that three activities were central to the iterative visualization construction process: data attribute selection, visual template selection, and visual mapping specification. The major barriers faced by the participants were translating questions into data attributes, designing visual mappings, and interpreting the visualizations. Partial specification was common, and the participants used simple heuristics and preferred visualizations they were already familiar with, such as bar, line and pie charts. We derived abstract models from our observations that describe barriers in the data exploration process and uncovered how information visualization novices think about visualization specifications.

This gap leads to a lack of distinction between the ends and means of a task, limiting the potential for rigorous analysis. We contribute a multi-level typology of visualization tasks to address this gap, distinguishing why and how a visualization task is performed, as well as what the task inputs and outputs are. Our typology allows complex tasks to be expressed as sequences of interdependent simpler tasks, resulting in concise and flexible descriptions for tasks of varying complexity and scope. It provides abstract rather than domain-specific descriptions of tasks, so that useful comparisons can be made between visualization systems targeted at different application domains. This descriptive power supports a level of analysis required for the generation of new designs, by guiding the translation of domain-specific problems into abstract tasks, and for the qualitative evaluation of visualization usage. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach in a detailed case study, comparing task descriptions from our typology to those derived from related work. We also discuss the similarities and differences between our typology and over two dozen extant classification systems and theoretical frameworks from the literatures of visualization, human-computer interaction, information retrieval, communications, and cartography.",Matthew Brehmer;Tamara Munzner,Matthew Brehmer;Tamara Munzner,University of British Columbia;University of British Columbia,10.1109/TVCG.2007.70541;10.1109/TVCG.2012.219;10.1109/INFVIS.1996.559213;10.1109/TVCG.2012.213;10.1109/TVCG.2012.273;10.1109/INFVIS.2005.1532136;10.1109/TVCG.2010.177;10.1109/TVCG.2007.70539;10.1109/INFVIS.2002.1173148;10.1109/TVCG.2007.70515;10.1109/TVCG.2012.204;10.1109/TVCG.2009.111;10.1109/TVCG.2008.109;10.1109/VISUAL.1992.235203;10.1109/INFVIS.2004.59;10.1109/VAST.2008.4677365;10.1109/VAST.2011.6102438;10.1109/TVCG.2008.121;10.1109/TVCG.2008.137;10.1109/INFVIS.1998.729560;10.1109/INFVIS.2004.10;10.1109/TVCG.2012.252;10.1109/VISUAL.1990.146375,"Typology, visualization models, task and requirements analysis, qualitative evaluation",164.0,166.0,84.0,

Humans play a central role in generating knowledge from the snippets of evidence emerging from visual data analysis. Although prior research provides frameworks that generalize this process, their scope is often narrowly focused so they do not encompass different perspectives at different levels. This paper proposes a knowledge generation model for visual analytics that ties together these diverse frameworks, yet retains previously developed models (e.g., KDD process) to describe individual segments of the overall visual analytic processes. To test its utility, a real world visual analytics system is compared against the model, demonstrating that the knowledge generation process model provides a useful guideline when developing and evaluating such systems. The model is used to effectively compare different data analysis systems. Furthermore, the model provides a common language and description of visual analytic processes, which can be used for communication between researchers. At the end, our model reflects areas of research that future researchers can embark on.",Dominik Sacha;Andreas Stoffel;Florian Stoffel;Bum Chul Kwon;Geoffrey P. Ellis;Daniel A.
